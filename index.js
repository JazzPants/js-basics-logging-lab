const driver = 'bob';

console.log('this code was called');

console.log(driver);

console.log(driver, 'is the driver variable name');
//console.log(`${driver}`, 'is the driver variable name'); //test solution with two arguments
//console.log(`${driver} is the driver variable name`); also works
//both -> bob is the driver variable name
